    <h1>About us</h1>

    <p>
      The purpose of our project is to assist high school students learn about Australia’s involvement in WWI, and what
      day-to-day life was like in Australia during the war. Based on our group's research and our collective experiences
      of static and unengaging online learning during lockdowns over the past 18 months, we wanted to create a learning
      supplement that is engaging, novel, and entices users to explore and interact with information. During our
      research into WWI, we found that a lot of resources focus on the battles, conflict, and casualties of the war,
      however, after exploring our chosen datasets, we found that they were rich in information that showed what life
      was like in Australia during the war. This information included newspaper articles, images, and captions that
      portrayed carnivals in West End, dress-up days at hospitals, school-life, butterfly collectors, and girls cricket
      teams at local schools.

      While the state library of Queensland datasets do provide an interesting look into day-to-day life during WWI,
      there are gaps in the information that they provide and it is important to acknowledge that. As the dataset is
      based on excerpts from newspapers, the content is subject to any prejudice that the editors and writers may have
      had. Additionally, based on our review of the datasets, there is no mention of First Nations people in the dataset
      or their experiences in the war. Therefore, while we do state that we want to teach our users about day-to-day
      life in Australia and Australian experiences in WWI, our datasets do leave out First Nations people and in future
      iterations or versions of this concept we would ideally include their views, stories and experiences as well.
